# ``PropertyBased``

PropertyBased is a Swift 6 library that enables Property-Based Testing in `swift-testing`, similar to QuickCheck for Haskell or FsCheck for F# and C#.

Property-Based Testing can be used as an alternative for (or in addition to) testing with hardcoded values. Run tests with random values, and easily switch to specific values when debugging a test failure.
